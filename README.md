# Better in Bulk: What the Consumer Habits of CAP 5771 Can Reveal Compared Alongside the Average Costco Customer

This repository contains documentation, datasets, and results of the final project completed for Data Mining (CAP 5771) at Florida State University during the Fall 2025 semester.

**Instructions for Use:**
If you are running our code in Google CoLab, please upload the specified datasets to the file explorer on the left hand side of the IDE. If the dataset files are titled different to the titles seen within the CSV loader, please change them to the file name used in the code. All results should be reproducible with the same values as listed in the final report. If you encounter any issues with the code or have other questions, **please contact Hayden Kirkeide at hlk21@fsu.edu** so that I may be able to assist.
